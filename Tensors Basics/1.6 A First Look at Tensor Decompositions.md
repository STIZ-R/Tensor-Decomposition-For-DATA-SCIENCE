## 1.6 A First Look at Tensor Decompositions

<br>

Tensor decompositions can be seen as a set of tensors that can be multiplied together to reconstruct the initial input. <br>
Unlike matrix decompositions, tensor decompositions result in an approximation of the input. <br>
The majority of tensor decompositions are viewed as a representation of low-rank matrix approximations for higher-order data.
