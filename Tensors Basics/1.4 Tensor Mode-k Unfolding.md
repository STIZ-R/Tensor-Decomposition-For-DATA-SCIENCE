## 1.4 Tensor Mode-*k* Unfloding

We can rearrange a tensor to form multiple matrices. The process is called **unfolding** or also known as **matricization**.

> **Definition (Informal Definition of Mode-*k* Unfolding)** <br>
> The **mode-*k* unfolding** of a tensor is a matrix whose columns are the mode-*k* fibers of that tensor, denoted as $\textbf{X}_{(k)}$.

Let take a 3-way tensor of size $2 \times 2 \times 2$. Hera are the different mode-*k* unfolding.
