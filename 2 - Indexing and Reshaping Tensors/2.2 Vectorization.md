# 2.2 Vectorization

The **vectorization** tranforms a tensor into a vector. It is important to understand since it's related on how the tensor is stored in computer memory.

## 2.2.1 Vectorizing 3-way Tensors

Take a 3-way tensor $X$ of size $m \times n \times p$, the columnar vector of size $q = mnp$ is $vec(X)$.

```math
vec(X) = \begin{bmatrix} x_{111} \\ x_{211} \\ . \\ . \\ . \\ x_{mnp} \end{bmatrix} = \qquad \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ . \\. \\ . \\ x_q \end{bmatrix}
```

## Exercises 

> ** Exercise 2.21** <br>
> Show that the figure 1 is identical to a matrix vectorization for an $m \times n \times p$ tensor with $p=1$

### Solution - Exercise 2.21

We know that the natural linear index for $m \times n \times p$ is $l = 1 + (i - 1) + m(j - 1) + mn(k - 1)$ and if $p=1$, then $k = 1$ so, it's equal to $l = 1 + (i - 1) + m(j - 1)$. Which is the same thing as a matrix of size $m \times n$.
