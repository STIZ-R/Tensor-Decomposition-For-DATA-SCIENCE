## 2.1 Linear Indexing  

For a 4-way tensor $\textbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n \times p \times q}$ , every entry is identified by a 4-tuple of the form $(i,j,k,l) \in [m] \otimes [n] \otimes [p] \otimes [q]$. Another common convention is **linear indexing**, where each entry is mapped to a single index $l \in [mnpq]$.
