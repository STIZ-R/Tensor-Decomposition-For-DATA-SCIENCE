# Tensor Decomposition for Data Science – Notes

Personal notes based on the book  
**“Tensor Decomposition for Data Science” by Grey Ballard & Tamara G. Kolda**.

## Contents

- Structured chapter-by-chapter notes
- Key definitions (tensors, fibers, slices, matricization, Tucker, CP, etc.)
- Worked examples
- Exercise statements and solutions

## How this repo is organized
